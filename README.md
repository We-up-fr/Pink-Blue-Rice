Sorry for the pretty uninspired name but this is the repo for my rice. The polybar config is not very well written but I’m probably gonna go back and clean up some of the messy stuff. I would suggest using these dots with Picom.

Here’s some elements that I used and would recommend checking out:

Nicer Neofetch Configs: https://github.com/Chick2D/neofetch-themes

Cue Music Player (with Images and Ascii): https://github.com/ravachol/cue

Tty-clock: not gonna link this one because it’s available on pretty much every package manager
